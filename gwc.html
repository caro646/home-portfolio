  <h3> PYTHTON VS. SCRATCH</h3>
  <p>Scracth is much more straightforward compared to python, which requires you to do more research.<br>
    However, they are both really fun to use and you can get them to do many things. <br>
    Also, when working with Python I would get more fustrated because the error in your code is not always clear to you.</p>
<br>
  <h3> Making filters on Python</h3>
  <p>Personally I found nested lists a bit confusing at first but I finally got it!</p>
    <br><p> For example, if you have the code below:</p>
    <img src="lists.jpg" alt=list-code>
<p> When making these filters, a difficulty I faced was making a variable that would sum up the (r,g,b) values of each pixel</p>
    <p>Also, I had to pseudo code how I would get an input image and change the RGB values of each pixel and get it to apend and recolor to make a new image. </p>
